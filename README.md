Design I followed:

Problems I've faced:
                    forgetting about tags,
                    not following a consistent structure,
                    flex not acting how I want it,
                    CSS rules not working because of some upper rule that overwrittens the new one.

What I've learned from this project:
                    how to structure my html code,
                    how to use display: flex;,
                    how to think about the project before starting to write,
                    that I can manage something that seems impossible at first.


Final thoughts: 
                    the project can be improved, feel like remaking it but now I have other things to care about.
                    if it works it works
